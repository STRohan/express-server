# Features of VS Code  

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) is **lightweight, fast** and comes with a **_command palette, multiple cursor selection, snippets, and code auto-completion._**  
##  FEATURES 
### 1. Intellisense  
IntelliSense is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence. This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes. These is derived from several contextual factors such as _the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes_ within the file.  
IntelliSense supports a number of programming language **out-of-the-box, including Sass, LESS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP**. Some extensions to include IntelliSense for other programming languages are also available. It is a great feature to improve productivity.

###2. Peek  
While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.  


With Peek, you can select a function then hit Shift + F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, and a few other programming languages.

### 3. CLI
Similar to SublimeText with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is equipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install.  

In Windows, the CLI will have already been installed along with the app. The CLI is accessible through the Command Prompt. In OS X, it can be installed and uninstalled through the Command Palette.  

You can use the CLI to open a particular directory to Visual Studio Code, or open your current project directory in Terminal or Command Prompt directly from the editor.

###4. Built-in Git  
Visual Studio Code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar, you will find the Git icon where you can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as **_commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file._**
  
In addition, if you are making changes on a Git repository, the Visual Studio will show color indicators in the code editor gutter, indicating where you have made the modifications.

###5. Task Runner  
Last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience.
  
To use this feature, we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like **Grunt, Gulp, or MSBuild** if provided. Once the configuration is set, we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Tasks will list all related commands.

## Some of the Useful Plugins in VS Code  



 
### 1. Quokka

Quokka is a debugging tool that gives live feedback on the code you are writing. It shows you previews of the results of functions and calculated values for variables. The extension is easy to configure and works out of the box with **JSX or TypeScript projects**.

###2. Faker

Quickly insert placeholder data using the popular Faker JavaScript library. You can generate **random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, or just paragraphs of classic Lorem Ipsum.** Each category has various subcategories so you can make the data fit your needs.

###3. CSS Peek

WIth this extension you can trace the definitions of CSS classes and ids in your stylesheets. When you right click on a selector in your _HTML files_, choosing the options Go to **Definition and Peek** definition will send you to the _CSS code_ in which you've styled them.

###4. HTML Boilerplate

The **HTML boilerplate** extension will save you from having to manually write the head and body tags of a new HTML document. Just type html in an empty file, hit the Tab key, and a clean document structure will be generated.

###5. Prettier

**Prettier** is the most popular code formatter in web dev right now. It allows your team's code look the same, no matter who wrote it. This extension makes it possible to automatically apply Prettier and quickly format whole JS and CSS documents. If you also want to throw ESLint in the mix, there is Prettier - Eslint.

###6. Color Info

Small plugin that gives you various information about the colors you've used in your **CSS**. By hovering on a color you can see a larger preview of how it looks, as well as info about its translation to all formats _(hex, rgb, hsl, and cmyk)._

###7. SVG Viewer

This extension adds a number of utilities for working with **SVGs** in **Visual Studio Code**. It makes it possible to render SVG files and see how they look like without having to leave the editor. There are also options for converting to PNG and generating data URI schemes.

###8. Open-In-Browser

VSCode doesn't offer any built-in interface for opening files directly in the browser. This extension adds a Open With **Default Browser** item to the contextual menu, as well as command palette options for opening in a client of your choice **_(Firefox, Chrome, IE)._**
