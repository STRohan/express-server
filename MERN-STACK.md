Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node.js on the backend, the MERN stack is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page application.

###1. MongoDB
MongoDB is an **open source** _database management system (DBMS)_ that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. It is one of numerous nonrelational database technologies which arose in the mid-2000s under the [NoSQL](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/NoSQL-Not-Only-SQL) banner for use in big data applications and other processing jobs involving data that doesn't fit well in a rigid relational model. Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents.

###2. Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

###3. Return

React (_**also known as React.js or React JS**_) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by **Facebook** and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for **state management, routing, and interaction** with an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).

###4. NodeJS
Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment** that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a **_"JavaScript everywhere"_** paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
